            Leadership trait is one of the most sought after trait of personality in modern<br>
            world. There is a huge debate on what qualities make a person a good leader.<br>
            Some people believe that for an leader to be most effective he or she should <br>
            have a sound moral judgement rather than ability to maintain the respect of his<br>
            or her peers. This essay will discuss the argument in detail and put forward two<br>
            reasons to support why a great moral judgement is more important than ability<br>
            to maintain the respect of his or her peers.<br>

            Leaders have the ability to change the course of mankind. History has been a <br>
            huge evidence all over the world for this case. It is absolutely necessary <br>
            for human race to adapt through the time to its circumstances and be <br>
            progressive. For that purpose a leader having well calibrated moral <br>
            compass essential. A person with charge with poor moral judgment while <br>
            seeking glory and progress often overlooks human rights,equality and justice. <br>
            One of the core reasons behind catastrophic events such as World War I and <br>
            World War II was people in power with unchecked poor moral compass. <br>
            It clearly indicates that person without good morals ultimatley brings chaos <br>
            disturbing balance of the society<br>

        </p>
        <p>
            Further, respect is a powerful human emotion that is a factor in <br>
            leader-follower relation. Hence while choosing a leader it should be consider <br>
            if the respect is mutual. Non conditional respect to leader feeds the ego. <br>
            A leader who is well respected by his peers and shares the same feeling with <br>
            them is in modern terms of leadership is a brilliant leader. Successful sports<br>
            teams like FC Barcelona or Indian cricket team share a common factor of mutual <br>
            respect between leadership and other memebrs. Uni-directional respect to the <br>
            leaders forms a divide between leadership and other people.<br>

        </p>
        <p>
            One might argue that a leader who rules with utmost respect by his peer <br>
            can work more efficiently and freely. But isnt that the reason why we should <br>
            have a leader with moral judgement and mutual respect? There must be some <br>
            accountibility and responsibility to the leader and his decision and it only <br>
            comes with sound moral judgement and mutual feeling of respect. Preferring <br>
            moral compass in leadership quality will be a positive lesson learned from <br>
            history.<br>
